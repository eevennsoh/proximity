# Mini-proxy

This is a small configurable proxy with the aim of being able to compile it to proxy anything. This was a small fun project with the aim of proxying AI-Gateway to use OSS AI tools with the models it provides.

Ai-Gateway rest documentation: https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/ai-gateway/rest/,

It requires [postman-slauthtoken](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-developers/postman-slauthtoken/src/master/README.md) to get slauth tokens to properly authenticate to AI-Gateway.

You can run it locally using `make` or run the image docker the docker compose file provided.
